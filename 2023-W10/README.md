### Week of 2023-03-06
Prepared a [report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xhsnzxjpvtfc) on the state-of-the-art for anomaly detection in power grid OT networks. Presented to Austen, Panayot, and Colin. Colin pointed out that anomaly detection is not as useful to utility operators as anomaly diagnosis.

Anomaly diagnosis is a benefit of certain anomaly detection techniques such as [MTAD-GAT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02040.pdf), which utilizes [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) to model relationships between input time-series. Colin and I decided to investigate these attention mechanisms further.
