### Week of 2023-03-13
More reading about attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks, and Graph Attention Networks. Came upon the [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PyG) library, which contains implementations of several Graph Neural Networks, including GATs.

My current goal is to go through the PyG tutorials and learn how to implement MTAD-GAT and some sort of anomaly diagnosis on the RTS-GMLC data. Hopefully PyG plays well with Pyro and allows me to implement both GATs and VAEs in the same codebase, which MTAD-GAT requires.
