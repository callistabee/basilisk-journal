### Week of 2023-02-27

#### Monday:
The OIT research cluster has been down for a few days, but Panayot directed me to Google Colab for compute resources.
I've made a project folder on Drive (accessible to people with PSU login):

#### Tuesday:
I was given the link to the [RTS-GMLC repository](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC) which contains
lots of real-time power grid data. I've only started to sift through it. This also helped me contextualize
[this repository](https://github.com/Gombessa1938/llnl_summer) from a previous student, which contains
models for some of this power grid data.

#### Wednesday:
Sifted through the RTS-GMLC data a little more. I will try to make a slide deck w/figures to
organize my thoughts about where to go from here.
